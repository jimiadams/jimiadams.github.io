I've had a long-standing interest in drawing on network theory to evaluate and improve methods - particularly of data collection. This has lead to my involvement in a number of primary data collection projects (in Malawi, South Africa and New York City), and evaluation of secondary network data (in Colorado Springs among others).

I'm presently leading an initiative supported by INSNA to produce a white paper that's aiming to smooth the IRB approval process for network researchers at their local institutions.

One of my favorite previous projects in this vein outside of data collection/evaluation was working with [Gina Lovasi](https://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/faculty/Gina%20Lovasi/), and later [Katie Faust](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=4660), to compile advances in the combination of network and spatial analytic approaches, which culminated in the publication of a special isse of *[Social Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/social-networks/vol/34/issue/1)*.
