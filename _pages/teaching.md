### Graduate
#### CU-Denver
  - HBSC 7011, **Theoretical Perspectives in Health & Behavioral Sciences** - This course focuses on a range of theoretical aspects from across the social sciences that are foundational to population health. [*Syllabus*](../files/2019F_HBSC7011_syllabus.pdf): 2019F, 2017F
  - HBSC 7041, **Research Design** - I sought to focus on the principles of research design, while also introducing the practicalities, rather than the other way around. [*Syllabus*](../files/2019S_HBSC7041_syllabus.pdf): 2019S
  - HBSC 7111, **Applications of Health & Behavioral Sciences** - This serves as a capstone course, which is mostly student-led, culminating in a draft of their dissertation proposals. [*Syllabus*](../files/2017S_HBSC7111_syllabus.pdf): 2017S
  - HBSC 7400, **Social Network Analysis** - A "soup-to-nuts" overview of current approaches of the field, including lecture, discussion, and computational tutorials (in R). [*Syllabus*](../files/2016S_HBSC7400_syllabus.pdf): 2016S
  - HBSC 7071, **Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health** - This seminar aims to introduce a broad range of perspectives theoretical and empirical perspectives represented in the field of population health.[*Syllabus*](../files/2019S_HBSC7041_syllabus.pdf): 2014F

#### American University
  - SOCY 696, **Social Network Analysis** - This was the first time I had the chance to teach SNA as a graduate course. [*Syllabus*](../files/2014S_SOCY696_syllabus.pdf): 2014S
  
#### Arizona State University
  - SOC/FAS 598, **Social Network Methods in Health Research** - This may be my favorite course I've had the chance to teach. A number of our students needed a course that combined methods & a "topical" elective in one. So I pulled this together to take a project-focused survey of research design approaches taken in the field. It later ended up serving as the backbone of the approach I took in my SAGE book. [*Syllabus*](../files/2012S_SOC598_syllabus.pdf): 2012S.
  - Soc 585, **Sociological Theory** - A bit last minute, I ended up covering our graduate theory seminar. So, we ended up drawing heavily on a set of readers with excerpts from primary sources. [*Syllabus*](../files/2011S_SOC585_syllabus): 2011S

While these courses represent some of my teaching interests, further course topics i am interested in include, Organizations, Sociology of Religion, Science of Science, global HIV/AIDS, and likely a few others I'm not thinking of as courses at the moment. If you are a student interested in these topics, or an instructor who may want to explore collaborative teaching, let me know.
