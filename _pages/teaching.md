### Graduate
#### South Carolina
  - SOCY 732, **Inferential Network Analysis** - A "second" course in SNA, focused on modeling frameworks for networks' causes and effects. [*Syllabus*](../files/2025S_Socy732_syllabus.pdf): 2025S
  
#### CU-Denver
  - HBSC 7011, **Theoretical Perspectives in Health & Behavioral Sciences** - This course focuses on a range of theoretical aspects from across the social sciences that are foundational to population health. [*Syllabus*](../files/2021F_HBSC7011_syllabus.pdf): 2023F, 2021F, 2019F, 2017F
  - HBSC 7041, **Research Design** - I sought to focus on the principles of research design, while also introducing the practicalities, rather than the other way around. [*Syllabus*](../files/2023S_HBSC7041_syllabus.pdf): 2023S, 2019S
  - HBSC 7071, **Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health** - This seminar aims to introduce a broad range of theoretical and empirical perspectives represented in the field of population health. [*Syllabus*](../files/2014F_HBSC7071_syllabus.pdf): 2014F
  - HBSC 7111, **Applications of Health & Behavioral Sciences** - This serves as a capstone course, which is mostly student-led, culminating in a draft of their dissertation proposals. [*Syllabus*](../files/2017S_HBSC7111_syllabus.pdf): 2017S
  - HBSC 7400, **Social Network Analysis** - A "soup-to-nuts" overview of current approaches of the field, including lecture, discussion, and computational tutorials (in R). [*Syllabus*](../files/2016S_HBSC7400_syllabus.pdf): 2016S

#### American University
  - SOCY 696, **Social Network Analysis** - This was the first time I had the chance to teach SNA as a graduate course. [*Syllabus*](../files/2014S_SOCY696_syllabus.pdf): 2014S
  
#### Arizona State University
  - SOC/FAS 598, **Social Network Methods in Health Research** - This may be my favorite course I've had the chance to teach. A number of our students needed a course that combined methods & a "topical" elective in one. So I pulled this together to take a project-focused survey of research design approaches taken in the field. It later ended up serving as the backbone of the approach I took in my SAGE book. [*Syllabus*](../files/2012S_SOC598_syllabus.pdf): 2012S.
  - Soc 585, **Sociological Theory** - A bit last minute, I ended up covering our graduate theory seminar. So, we ended up drawing heavily on a set of readers with excerpts from primary sources. [*Syllabus*](../files/2011S_SOC585_syllabus): 2011S

### Workshops
#### Social Network Analysis
  - [Statistical Horizons](https://statisticalhorizons.com/seminars/introduction-to-social-network-analysis3/), - This was a 3-day workshop providing overview of *descriptive* approaches (ego composition, balance, density, distance, centralities, cohesion/clustering, & equivalence) to analyzing social network data conceptually, and in R.
  - [**ICPSR**](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/sumprog/index.html) - Hosted by the University of Michigan, this summer "stats camp" draws a range of graduate students, post docs, faculty, and others from across the social sciences who are interested advancing their methods chops. [*Syllabus*](../files/ICPSR_SNA_Syllabus.pdf): 2020 (online), 2019, 2017 (Boulder), 2016 (Ann Arbor)
  - [**EPIC**](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/episummercolumbia) - Hosted by Columbia University, this summer workshop series draws a range of public health scholars and professionals from across the globe who are interested in learning new methods. [*Syllabus*](../files/EPIC_SNA_Syllabus.pdf): 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013
  - **UT-MB** - I conducted a 2-day version (no labs) of these workshops for the department of Preventative Medicine & Community Health at University of Texas, Medical Branch.

While these courses represent some of my teaching interests, further course topics i am interested in include: data visualization, Organizations, Sociology of Religion, global HIV/AIDS, and likely a few others I'm not thinking of *as courses* at the moment. If you are a student interested in these topics, or an instructor who may want to explore collaborative teaching, let me know.
