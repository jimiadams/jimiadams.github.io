about me
------
In January 2024, I started a new position as Professor of [sociology](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/sociology/) at the University of South Carolina. This move comes after nearly a decade in the [Department of Health and Behavioral Sciences](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/hbsc/) at the [University of Colorado Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu), where I spent stints as the director of [Graduate Studies](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/hbsc/degree-programs/phd-program), and our [undergraduate programs in Public Health](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/hbsc/undergraduate-students).

Broadly, my research revolves around addressing how networks constrain or promote the diffusion of information and/or diseases through populations. Much of this work has focused on infectious diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS and covid-19). Recently, I have spent more time examining the integrative patterns and processes in problem-focused areas of science that draw from many academic disciplines (e.g., population health, demography, religion). In addition, I have a primary interest in using social network theory to improve strategies used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of primary data collection projects (e.g., my [book](/books/)).

Before USC, I was an Associate, then Full Professor of [Health & Behavioral Sciences](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/hbsc/) at University of Colorado Denver, where I was also an affiliate of the [Institute of Behavioral Science at CU-Boulder](https://ibs.colorado.edu/), an Assistant Professor in the [Sociology Department](https://www.american.edu/cas/sociology/) and affiliate of the [Center on Health, Risk and Society](https://www.american.edu/cas/sociology/chrs/) at [American University](https://www.american.edu), and an Assistant Professor of Sociology at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), where I was affiliated with the Center for Population Dynamics (sadly, now defunct) and the [Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity](https://complexity.asu.edu/csdc). Before that, I spent two years funded by the [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](https://www.rwjf.org) as a [Health and Society Scholar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827318302945) (also since disbanded) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), completed my PhD in the [Department of Sociology at Ohio State University](https://sociology.osu.edu), and received my BA (Interdisciplinary Studies) from [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu). When I'm away from work, I'm likely on a bike somewhere, or hanging with my dogs (ZoÃ« & Harley).
