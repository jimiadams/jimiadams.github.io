about me
------
I am a Professor in the [Department of Health and Behavioral Sciences](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/hbsc/) at the [University of Colorado Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu). I currently also serve as our program's Director of Graduate Studies, and previously completed a 3.5-year term as director of our [undergraduate programs in Public Health](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/hbsc/undergraduate-students).

Broadly, my research revolves around addressing how networks constrain or promote the diffusion of information and/or diseases through populations. Much of this work has focused on HIV/AIDS among populations in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, I have spent more time examining the integrative patterns and processes in problem-focused areas of science that draw from many academic disciplines (e.g., HIV/AIDS, demography, the environment). In addition, I have a primary interest in using social network theory to improve strategies used in the design and implementation of primary data collection projects. Check out my recent [book](/books/)!

Before coming to UCD, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Sociology Department](https://www.american.edu/cas/sociology/) and affiliate of the [Center on Health, Risk and Society](https://www.american.edu/cas/sociology/chrs/) at [American University](https://www.american.edu), and an Assistant Professor of Sociology at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu), where I was affiliated with the Center for Population Dynamics (sadly, now defunct) and the [Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity](https://complexity.asu.edu/csdc). Before that, I spent two years funded by the [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](https://www.rwjf.org) as a [Health and Society Scholar](http://www.healthandsocietyscholars.org) (also since disbanded) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), completed my PhD in the [Department of Sociology at Ohio State University](https://sociology.osu.edu), and received my BA (Interdisciplinary Studies) from [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu). Until I figure out how to add it to the sidebar, you can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://sciences.social/@jimiadams">Mastodon</a>.
