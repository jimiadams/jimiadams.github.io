Before it essentially led me to relatively full [burnout](https://jimi-adams.medium.com/whos-that-man-in-the-mirror-3e4ac1994111) in 2021, I spent a fair amount of time over about 18 months heavily involved in Covid-19 responses in various capacities. This is an overview of some of that work.

### INSNA Satellite Conference
Along with [David Lazer](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/), I organized a satellite conference alongside the annual INSNA (social network) meetings, which ran online July 20-22. About half of the talks are available linked from the [conference program](https://www.insna.org/covid-19-satellite-of-sunbelt).

### Colorado COVID-19 Modeling Team
Beginning in Sept 2021, I picked back up working with the [team](https://www.colorado-data.org/meet-the-team) I had for April-December 2020, modeling various aspects of SARS-COV-2 spread and other elements of COVID-19 response for the state of Colorado. I'm collecting those updates together here:

### Science Communication
In addition to those larger projects, I also wrote/presented a few pieces trying to publicly translate relevant elements of the pandemic:

- On [misperceptions about modeling](https://medium.com/@jimi.adams/projections-vs-predictions-redux-3d75eca07f4b), Sept 1 at *Medium*.
- On [misinformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfTsD9pjRmg), June 15 in a CU-Denver open Course.
- On [understanding epidemiological models](https://thesocietypages.org/specials/what-are-covid-19-models-modeling/), Apr 8 in *The Society Pages*.
- On [flattening the curve](https://iaphs.org/what-will-flattenthecurve-do/), Mar 15 for the IAPHS blog.
- On [some basics of epidemics](https://medium.com/@jimi.adams/over-hype-is-not-necessary-bb15dd85a9bb), Mar 7 at *Medium*.
