<p>Here's my co-authorship network. Circles are people (size proportional to # of collaborations), squares are papers. Color corresponds with component; layout of components is essentially random.
  I created this plot with the <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">igraph</a> and <a href="https://github.com/schochastics/roughnet">roughnet</a> packages in <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>.</p>

There are lots of other connections that I could add here, but for now I'll just mention a few key affiliations outside of my home department.
I'm on the editorial boards of these journals:
<ul>
 <li><i><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/csx">Contemporary Sociology</a></i></li>
 <li><i><a href="https://sciendo.com/journal/JOSS">Journal of Social Structure</a></i></li>
</ul>
I'm also courtesty faculty in the <a href="https://clas.ucdenver.edu/mathematical-and-statistical-sciences/">Department of Mathematical & Statistical Sciences</a>, and affiliate faculty in the <a href="https://behavioralscience.colorado.edu/unit/health-and-society">Health & Society program</a> and <a href="https://cupc.colorado.edu/">CU-Population Center</a> at CU-Boulder's <a href="https://behavioralscience.colorado.edu/">Institute of Behavioral Science</a>.</p>
